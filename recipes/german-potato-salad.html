			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>This is my mother's recipe. Everyone, German or not, loves it. It is easy to double the recipe as well.</p>
			<p>I often bring it to potlucks, and we also have it at home on special occasions.</p>
			<p>There are usually no leftovers, but if there are, they don't last long!</p>
			<h4>Ingredients</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>3 cups diced peeled potatoes</li>
				<li>4 slices bacon</li>
				<li>1 small onion, diced</li>
				<li>¼ cup white vinegar</li>
				<li>2 tablespoons water</li>
				<li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
				<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
				<li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
				<li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Steps</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Place the potatoes into a pot, and fill with enough water to cover.</li>
				<li>Bring to a boil, and cook for about 10 minutes, or until easily pierced with a fork.</li>
				<li>Drain, and set aside to cool.</li>
				<li>Place the bacon in a large deep skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
				<li>Fry until browned and crisp, turning as needed.</li>
				<li>Remove from the pan and set aside.</li>
				<li>Add onion to the bacon grease, and cook over medium heat until browned.</li>
				<li>Add the vinegar, water, sugar, salt and pepper to the pan.</li>
				<li>Bring to a boil, then add the potatoes and parsley.</li>
				<li>Crumble in half of the bacon. Heat through, then transfer to a serving dish. 
				Crumble the remaining bacon over the top, and serve warm.</p>
